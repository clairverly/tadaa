- Amounts with currency
- Specific dates or relative dates (tomorrow, next Monday)
- Categories or types
- Priorities (urgent, important)

### 3. Answer Follow-up Questions
The AI will ask for missing information one field at a time. Answer naturally:

### 5. Multiple Items
You can create multiple items in one conversation. After saving one item, just start describing the next one.

## Example Conversations

    (utilities, telco-internet, insurance, subscriptions, credit-loans, or general)

[Extraction Panel shows: Bill - Incomplete]
‚úì Name: Electricity Bill
‚úì Amount: $150
‚úì Due Date: 2024-01-19
‚ö†Ô∏è Still needed: category

You: utilities

    and categorized as utilities. Would you like to set up reminders or enable auto-pay?
